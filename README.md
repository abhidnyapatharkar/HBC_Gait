# HBC_Gait
 This repository contains the code for the paper "Healthy Bio-Core: A Framework for Selection of Homogeneous Healthy Biomedical Multivariate Time Series Employing Classification Performance," currently under publication. This is for the Gait dataset. The files include Jupyter notebooks for constructing the HBC framework using initial DTW calculations and the ROCKET classifier, as well as validating the framework with three other classifiers: DTW-NN, HIVE-COTE, and MUSE. Additionally, the processed data files required to run the codes are provided.
